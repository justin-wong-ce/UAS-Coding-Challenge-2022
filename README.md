# UAS-Challenge-2022

My submission of UAS's coding challenge: B-LNE-0

## Usage

Open `uas-challenge.sln` and click run. Profilings are done at the end of the tests for reference of run time.

## Important Notes

The challenge's specs dictate the "coordinates" and "radius" are integers. Here I am assuming they are only restricted to inputs but not the outputs.

If needed, the outputs could easily be ported to output integer coordinates for intersections by rounding the intersection in the direction of the nearest input coordinate.
